Welcome to Bosch.The Robert Bosch GmbH is looking forward to your application!Job DescriptionGenerative Adversarial Nets (GANs) are the state-of-the-art of unsupervised learning. They owe their success to their genuine game-theoretic learning principle, which yields a powerful tool to formulate complicated learning tasks in an intuitively simple way. Differently from the orthodox learning approaches, it is not straightforward, if possible at all, to express the eventual task the GAN learns as a loss function. Hence, it is equally difficult to derive Bayesian variants to draw probabilistic conclusions. This PhD project aims to develop novel GAN variants with Bayesian inference capabilities such as expressing arbitrarily complex data sets with probability densities, enabling access to the latent manifold on out-of-sample observations, and quantifying the model fit. During your PhD you will be part of an academically active machine learning basic research team at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI, www.bosch-ai.com).                              Help shape the future: You are responsible for the creative and pro-active development of new theoretical machine learning concepts and algorithms that enable Bayesian inference with GANs.                                                                   Take responsibility: Prototypical algorithm implementations and benchmarking on real-world data sets will be part of your PhD thesis.                                       Reliable implementation: You publish your results in top-tier conferences (ICML, NeurIPS, AISTATS, UAI, etc.) and journals (JMLR, PAMI, etc.).                     Experience cooperation: Your tasks will include literature screening and building close contact with the academic community.                     Networked communication: Right from day one you participate to the academic interactions within the BCAI research team.QualificationsEducation: Degree (master) in machine learning, mathematics, statistics, physics, computer science or related fields with excellent gradesPersonality: Intrinsic motivation for top-level research and scientific independenceExperience and Knowledge: Excellent theoretical skills proven by top course grades, general knowledge of machine learning, prior experience on scientific writing and prior knowledge on Bayesian inference is a plusLanguages: Fluent in English written and spokenAdditional InformationThe final Phd topic is subject to your university.Duration: 3 years"
